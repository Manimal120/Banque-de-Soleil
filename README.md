# FirstJavaProj

* The goal is to create an Client for a Bank.
* Used database to implement add, delete, select, update etc.
* Some of these varified functions is kind of stupid. I missed JS.
* Mainly used JavaSE + Mysql + JDBC + SWING.
* Encapsulation needs to improve.
* I'm trying to use Threads to improve it.
* Run with configuration of the JDBC.
